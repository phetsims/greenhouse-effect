Implementation notes for 'Molecules and Light' sim

This implementation was ported from the Java version of this sim.

'Molecules-and-Light' is a single screen sim which shares a significant amount of functionality and common code with
'The Greenhouse Effect' sim.

The directory structure under molecules-and-light/js is as follows:

    photon-absorption: Contains common code between 'Molecules and Light' and 'The Greenhouse Effect'. This includes
    all elements needed to describe photon and molecule interaction.

    moleculesandlight: Contains all other elements specific to the 'Molecules and Light' screen.

    Each of these directories are further separated into model and view packages.  The moleculesandlight directory only
    contains view elements because the photonabsorption directory handles all model components necessary for this sim.

axon.Property is used throughout the model and view for storage of properties and notification of changes.

Spatial units are relevant in this sim and model distances are described in picometers.  A model-view
transform is used throughout the sim and is defined in MoleculesAndLightScreenView.  This transform performs scaling,
inverts the y-axis, and transforms the reference point of the view.  The view reference point is the center left of the
ObservationWindow, specifically ( 275, 150 ).

In the QuadEmissionFrequencyControlPanel, an identity transform is used because spatial elements are not relevant.
Nodes are simply added to the control panel as visual descriptions of what the control panel does.
