Molecules And Light Screen:

        The model describes the interaction between photons and a molecules.  In general, a photon emitter fires a
        photon at a molecule with which it will or will not interact.  Whether or not a photon interacts with a given
        molecule is determined by fundamental aspects of nature.

        This model is composed of a photon emitter, photons, and molecules.  The molecules are modeled with constituent
        atoms and atomic bonds.

        The photon emitter, photons, and molecules are contained in an isolated window on the screen called the
        ObservationWindow.  This is where the user observes all photon and molecule interactions.  The flashlight
        looking object in the center left of the observation window is the photon emitter.

        A molecule can have many different absorption strategies which describe how it will interact with a given
        photon.  The possible options are BreakApartStrategy, which causes the molecule to break apart into two or more
        constituent molecules, ExcitationStrategy, which causes the molecule to enter an excited state,
        RotationStrategy, which causes the molecule to rotate, VibrationStrategy, which causes the molecule to vibrate,
        and NullPhotonAbsorptionStrategy, which represents no interaction between the photon and molecule.

        The user can decide which molecule to observe with the MoleculeSelectionPanel.  The possible Molecules are
        carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen gas, nitrogen dioxide, oxygen gas, and ozone.  The user can
        also select photons of a specific wavelength with the QuadEmissionFrequencyControlPanel.  Possible wavelengths
        are described by sections of the electromagnetic spectrum and the choices are microwave, infrared, visible, and
        ultraviolet.
