 * WaveSourceSpec is a simple class that is used to specify where waves can be produced - or sourced - by a wave source.
 * It specifies a minimum and maximum X value for where waves will be produced and a direction of travel.  This exists
 * because the wave production occurs in pairs of X value locations, and the source shifts back and forth between them
 * in order to create some variation.
