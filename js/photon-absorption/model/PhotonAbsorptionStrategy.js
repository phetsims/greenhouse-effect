/**
 * This is common code which will be used to define the photon absorption strategy for molecules in simulations like
 * "Greenhouse Gas" and "Molecules and Light".  This is the base model for the strategies that define how a molecule
 * reacts to a given photon.  It is responsible for the following:
 * - Whether a given photon should be absorbed.
 * - How the molecule reacts to the absorption, i.e. whether it vibrates, rotates, breaks apart, etc.
 * - Maintenance of any counters or timers associated with the reaction to the absorption, such as those related to
 *    re-emission of an absorbed photon.
